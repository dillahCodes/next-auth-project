/**
 * You must use a paid and valid email domain to avoid being marked as spam.
 * Free email services like Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook are not recommended for sending emails.
 * This is using a free email from https://app.brevo.com/settings/keys/smtp for testing,
 * with a limit of 100 emails per day.
 *
 * When sending emails, there are three key authentication pillars
 * to prevent emails from being marked as spam or rejected by recipients:
 * SPF, DKIM, & DMARC.
 *
 *        - SPF (Sender Policy Framework):
 *          Ensures that the sending mail server is authorized to send emails
 *          on behalf of a domain.
 *          Imagine a guest list at an eventâ€”only people on the list are allowed in.
 *
 *        - DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail):
 *          Adds a cryptographic signature to the email, proving that the email
 *          has not been altered during transit and was genuinely sent from the domain.
 *          Imagine sealing a letter with wax; if the seal is broken, you know it was tampered with.
 *
 *        - DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance):
 *          Defines how recipients should handle emails that fail SPF or DKIM checks.
 *          It also provides reporting for visibility into unauthorized email use.
 *          Imagine a security policy that instructs the guards on what to do
 *          if someone tries to enter with a fake ID.
